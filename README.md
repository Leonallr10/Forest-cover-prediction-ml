## 1. Introduction

The Forest Cover Prediction project focuses on predicting seven different forest cover types within the Roosevelt National Forest, located in northern Colorado, United States. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data and is enriched with independent variables derived from the US Geological Survey and additional USFS data. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the project's objectives, study area, and essential dataset characteristics.

## 2. Objective

The primary objective is to develop a predictive model capable of accurately classifying forest cover types in 30x30 meter cells within the Roosevelt National Forest. The model's purpose is to enhance our understanding of ecological processes and natural cover types, particularly in wilderness areas with minimal human-caused disturbances.

## 3. Study Area

The project's study area encompasses the expansive Roosevelt National Forest in northern Colorado, covering approximately 813,799 acres (around 1,270 square miles). This ecologically significant forest hosts four designated wilderness areas: Rawah Wilderness Area, Neota Wilderness Area, Comanche Peak Wilderness Area, and Cache la Poudre Wilderness Area. These areas, characterized by their pristine nature, allow for the observation of forest cover types shaped primarily by ecological processes.

## 4. Classes Used

The project involves predicting seven distinct forest cover types, each assigned a numerical label:
- Spruce/Fir - 1
- Lodgepole Pine - 2
- Ponderosa Pine - 3
- Cottonwood - 4
- Willow - 5
- Aspen - 6
- Douglas-fir - 7
- Krummholz - 8

## 5. Methods and Techniques

### a. Preprocessing
   - Data preprocessing was conducted to handle missing values, outliers, and standardize features.

### b. Feature Selection
   - A total of 55 features were selected from the dataset, providing relevant information for the classification task.

### c. Classification Models
   - The following classification algorithms were employed:
      - Logistic Regression
      - Gradient Boosting
      - Random Forest
      - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
      - CatBoost

### d. Ensemble Models
   - Various ensemble models, including Bagging, Stacking, and AdaBoost, were implemented.

### e. Stacking Models
   - Stacking models included Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.

### f. Clustering
   - K-Means and Generalized Clustering techniques were explored.

### g. Dimension Reduction
   - Techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) were employed for dimensionality reduction.

## 6. Metrics of Evaluation

Evaluation metrics were employed to assess model performance:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall

## 7. Hyperparameter Tuning

Grid search was conducted for each model to optimize hyperparameters. Additionally, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Area Under the Curve (AUC) curves were analyzed to evaluate model robustness.

## 8. Conclusion

The comprehensive approach to preprocessing, feature selection, and model implementation, along with a thorough evaluation using various metrics, ensures a rigorous analysis of forest cover prediction within the Roosevelt National Forest. The diversity of models and techniques employed reflects a comprehensive exploration of predictive capabilities in this ecological context.
